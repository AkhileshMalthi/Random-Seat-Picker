# Random Seat Picker 

This is a simple Random Seat Picker web app that allows you to randomly select a seat from a grid of rows and columns. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and features a dark mode theme.

## Features
- **Dynamic Grid Layout**: The app generates a seating area grid based on user inputs for rows and columns.
- **Random Seat Selection**: Click the **Pick Random Seat** button to randomly highlight a seat in the grid. The seat will remain selected until a new seat is picked.
- **Seat Availability**: Once a seat is selected, it becomes disabled and cannot be picked again.
- **Smooth Scroll and Focus**: After a seat is picked, the app automatically scrolls and focuses on the selected seat.
- **Dark Mode Theme**: The entire interface is styled with a modern dark theme.
